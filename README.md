DIY Watermeter with pulse sensor

Basically just a 5v inductive sensor tie-rapped to the water meter and connected to pin D1 of the ESP8266(wemos D1 mini)

Sensor: LJ18A3-8Z/BX (few bucks on Ali)

You can install it with a 3D printed bracket, to look nice:

Or just fish an L bracket out of the parts bin, drill a 16mm hole in it and zip-tie it to the water meter like I did:

and just leave the Wemos dangling from the usb cable. Not recommended if you enjoy a neat utility closet.
