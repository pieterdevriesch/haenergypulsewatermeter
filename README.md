DIY Watermeter with pulse sensor

Hardware based on https://www.pieterbrinkman.com/2022/02/02/build-a-cheap-water-usage-sensor-using-esphome-home-assistant-and-a-proximity-sensor/
but I never got his software config to work. 
Basically just a 5v inductive sensor tie-rapped to the water meter and connected to pin D1 of the ESP8266(wemos D1 mini)

Hopefully with this .yaml config it will work with the new HA energy dashboard water measurement.
