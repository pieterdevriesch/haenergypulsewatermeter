DIY Watermeter with pulse sensor

Hardware based on https://www.pieterbrinkman.com/2022/02/02/build-a-cheap-water-usage-sensor-using-esphome-home-assistant-and-a-proximity-sensor/
but I never got his software config to work. 
Basically just a 5v inductive sensor tie-rapped to the water meter and connected to pin D1 of the ESP8266(wemos D1 mini)

Sensor: LJ18A3-8Z/BX (few bucks on Ali)

Hopefully with this .yaml config it will work with the new HA energy dashboard water measurement.
